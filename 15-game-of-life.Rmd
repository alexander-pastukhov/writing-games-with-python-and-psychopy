# Game of life (NumPy)

Today you will be programming the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. This is not really a game but rather a simulation where you set initial conditions up and observe how the population evolves. The rules, [as described on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), are very simple:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Despite rules simplicity they produce remarkable evolution of a cell culture and give rise to many dynamic or static configurations. Here is an example simulation with a random starting state.

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), results = 'asis', echo = F}
cat(
'<div style="text-align:center;"><video controls>
    <source src="videos/game-of-life.m4v" type="video/mp4"> 
  </video></div>'
)
```

## Implementing  the rules
To program the game, you need to count live neighbors for every cell and use the rules above to decide whether it will be alive or dead on the _next_ iteration. The latter bit is important, you need to evaluate all cells at their current state, you cannot change their status during that period. Accordingly, on each iteration you need to a create _new_ cell culture and then overwrite the original one.

Our cells will live in a rectangular world, so you need to count number of neighbors in the 8 cells around it, as shown in the left hand-side image below (index / location of the dot in question is assumed to be _i, j_).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/game-of-life-grid.png")
```

However, things become slightly trickier, if a cell lies on the border of the world, as depicted on the right hand-side. The same rules for living or dying still apply but when counting neighbors you need to make sure that we do not try to access cells _outside_ of the world (marked in red). If we mess up our indexing, at best we will get an error, at worst we will access wrong elements. E.g., when our index is negative, Python will not issue a mistake but will simply count elements _from the end_.
